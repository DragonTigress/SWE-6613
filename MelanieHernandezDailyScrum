Scrums for Sprint 2

2/28/24
-Working on event handling for when someone enters text in the fields, to show errors when they don't match a pattern
-Haven't got the code to work, still working on event handling
-None so far

3/1/24
-Troubles getting the JavaScript to receive inputs and output an error message
-Working on getting the JavaScript to work with the html code
-None so far

3/4/24
-Got password validation to work and linked external script to html code. 
-Will work on getting the validation for email and not leaving the other fields blank
-None so far

3/5/24
-Added validation for the email, phone number and re-type password fields with error messages
-Will work on calling API to add user information if it doesn't find a matching email address
-None so far

3/16/24
-Been working on the API calls since 3/5. I have added first name and last name regex patterns to make sure users input names correctly.
Started on the API calls. It now gets to the email parameter with an error but goes through firstName, LastName and contactNumber before producing the error
Also had to add backend database on my pc along with the spring boot to allow for the backend application to be running while trying the front end API call.
-Continue to work on the API call so that I can add it to the other pages for those fields as well
-Not being able to get the API call without the bugs. It still isn't putting the information in the backend but is almost there
